# Count Backwards Task
========

An implementation of a count backwarks tasks to induce stress under lab conditions.

## General information
The test is intended to challenge participants to count backwards in various decrements from a random 3-digit number. It is inspired by the 'Serial Sevens' tasks, which is used in clinical tests to assess mental functions. While the participant follows the instructions on the screen and calls out the sequence of numbers, the experimenter puts additional pressure on the subject by requesting to hurry up. If the participant calls out a wrong number, the experiementer intervenes by pressing a key and the task is reset.
